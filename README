1DCSEMQWE:
An Open-Source 1D Forward Modeling Program for Controlled-Source Electromagnetic Method
using Quadrature with Extrapolation technique

For compiling and running the program, please see the INSTALL.txt file.

For guideline detail, please have a look at the manusript in /doc folder

List of currently supported features:
+ Cartesian coordinate system.
+ Computes all electromagnetic fields' x, y, and z-components.
+ Supports computation of both real and imaginary components of the fields.
+ Transmitters and receivers can be located anywhere.
+ Supports both electric and magnetic dipoles.
+ Arbitrarily oriented transmitter.
+ Isotropic resistivity.
+ Supports computation for various frequencies at once.
